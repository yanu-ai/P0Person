# DO NOT FORK UNTIL THIS IS GONE

# Project 0: Person201

## Obtaining Project Code and Project Details

For details and FAQs, see [this _details_ document](docs/details.md) that has information on git, Java, the classes here, and more. This current file you're reading has project and coding details, but the linked document has more Java and git details, particularly about starting to code. That linked document includes information about project workflow including submitting code and analysis for grading via _Gradescope_. **Be sure to check [the _detail_ document](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall24/resources-201/-/blob/main/projectWorkflow.md) for how to use Git to obtain the project files, and workarounds if Git doesn't work yet for you. You'll need to refer to this P0 document when forking and cloning.**

## Recording on Zoom

For this project and every APT quiz, we ask that record your screen via Zoom. For APT quizzes, you will record for the full duration of the quiz, but for this project, you will only record **the first 20 minutes when you start coding** -- not when you start reading, but when you're ready to code. You'll submit a URL for a cloud Zoom recording [using the link https://duke.is/zoom-p0-fall24](https://duke.is/zoom-p0-fall24).

## Goals

* To modify a simple Java class, modify two driver programs, and create a new class to demonstrate understanding of records, classes, methods, and instance variables.
* To learn about running Java programs using the VSCode IDE
* To learn about using Git for project management.
* To learn about CompSci201 workflow for assignments: Git, Gradescope, helper hours.
* To learn about the difference between static and dynamic data sources, e.g., a file on your laptop and data accessible via a URL that can be updated by those in Compsci201

## Initial Engagement Points

You can earn five **early-project engagement** points for this project.

* Answer the questions on the [pre-project engagement form](https://bit.ly/p0-pre-engage) (2 points)
* Modify the definition of `Person p` in the file `PostPerson.java` to represent you, and run the program to post the information for the class to use. (3 points)

For the second engagement. You should use the latitude and longitude of what you consider either your hometown, where you last went to high school, or some city you'd like to visit (we will be creating a map of the cities identified by these coordinates). You can use your real name or you can use a pseudonym. For the final parameter, you **should use the name of one your favorite 9th street eateries**. It must be a restaurant from the following list:

"Juju", "Lime and Lemon", "Dain's Place", "Banh's Cuisine", "Blue Corn Cafe", "Monuts", "Alpaca", "Kiichi Ramen", "Bali Hai Mongolian Grill", "Burger Bach", "Vin Rouge", "Devil's Pizzeria", "The Loop", "Elmo's Diner", "Local 22", "Parizade", "Metro 8 Steakhouse", "Common Market", "Cosmic Cantina", "Happy + Hale", "International Delights", "Play Bowls", "Szechuan Mansion Hotpot", "Panera", "Zenfish Poke Bar", "Chicken Bee", "Mad Hatter Cafe", "Genji", "Jimmy John's", "Heavenly Buffaloes", "The Tavern", "Guasaca", "Shuckin' Shack"

## Developing the classes in Project P0: Person201

When you fork and clone the project, you'll be working primarily within the src folder with .java files -- many beginning with `Person201`. Your goal is to modify four programs/classes (`Person201.java`, `Person201Demo.java`, `CountEateries` and `Person201Nearby.java`), as well as to create a new program (`Person201Farthest.java`) to generate the desired output. As a challenge activity you'll be asked to determine the top/popular 9th street eateries among students in Compsci 201 this semester by creating a class/program `PopularEatery`.  


### Run `Person201Demo.java` and change `Person201.java`

First run the main method in `Person201Demo.java`, the output will be:

```
(037.80N,122.27W) claire, "Blue Corn Cafe"
(001.29S,036.82E) ricardo, "Elmo's Diner"
(040.71N,073.96W) julie, "Alpaca"
names: claire, ricardo, julie
Sam to Fred distance = 424.611 
```

Make changes to `Person201.java` by creating a _default constructor_ and then changing the definition of `Person201 c` in `Person201Demo` that's currently defined as someone named **julie** to be `Person201 c = new Person201()` (note: _default constructor_ called). You must edit `Person201.java` so that with this change the output of `Person201Demo` will be as shown below. See the [help-doc/FAQ](docs/details.md) for more details on default constructors. Note the third line is now different.

```
(037.80N,122.27W) claire, "Blue Corn Cafe"
(001.29S,036.82E) ricardo, "Elmo's Diner"
(035.99N,078.90E) Owen, "Dain's Place"
names: claire ricardo Owen
Sam to Fred distance = 424.611
```

Now that you've done this, make an additional change to the `main` method in file `Person201Demo.java` by creating a new `Person201` variable named `s` as follows:

`Person201 s = new Person201("Ethan", 40.6782, 73.0442, "Monuts");`

Next, change the definition of the array `people` to include `s` such that `s` appears after `c`, e.g., 
`Person201[] datas = {a,b,c,s}`. Run the program,  the output should be as shown here (note `c` still using default constructor):

```
(037.80N,122.27W) claire, "Blue Corn Cafe"
(001.29S,036.82E) ricardo, "Elmo's Diner"
(035.99N,078.90E) Owen, "Dain's Place"
(040.68N,073.04E) Ethan, "Monuts"
names: claire, ricardo, Owen, Ethan
Sam to Fred distance = 424.611
```

You're now done editing `Person201.java`!


### Running Person201Nearby and changing the Data Source

Run the program `Person201Nearby`. It reads a data file and finds all the people in the data file who are within 50 miles of a person named Ricardo who lives near Seattle. The program prints there are 16 people when run with zero changes. Change the value of the variable `threshold` until exactly 3 people live within `threshold` miles of Ricardo. **Find the smallest `threshold` value that yields 3 people**, sos that any value less will yield two people. You'll report on this value and how you obtained it in answering the *analysis questions* below.

Lines 11-13 in `Person201Nearby` specify three data sources: a regular text file named `foodlarge.txt` in the `data` folder, a `foodsmall.txt` file in the `data` folder (line 12), and a URL (line 13). 

How many people live within 50 miles of Ricardo when using the file `foodsmall` as the data source? Answer in **analysis questions** below. Then change the code so that it reads data from the URL specified by the variable `largeURL`. You'll need to call the appropriate method in `Person201Utilities` to read a URL for a file, e.g., rather than calling `readFile` you'll call `readURL`. Verify that you get the same results from the URL as from the file in the data folder --  since that URL references the same data as the file `foodlarge` in the `data` folder. You'll answer questions about these runs in the **analysis questions** section. 


### Create and Run a New Java Class: **Person201Farthest**

In the `src` folder create a new Java class named `Person201Farthest` (name the file `Person201Farthest.java`) that has only a `public static void main method` that allows the program to run. When run, the method should read the file `foodlarge.txt` in the `data` folder and determine the two distinct `Person201` objects that are the farthest apart. You may find the code in `Person201Nearby.java` useful in reasoning about the code you write. The program should print the two distinct objects that are farthest apart among all the objects created and returned when `PersonUtilities.readFile` is called from the code you write.

The `main` method you write *must* use the code below 
```
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String file = "data/foodlarge.txt";
        double min = 0;
        Person201 a = null;
        Person201 b = null;
        // TODO: finish this method 
        System.out.printf("farthest distance is %3.2f between %s and %s\n",min,a.name(),b.name());
    }
```
See [the details](docs/details.md) documentation for details/hints.

### Modifying the code in `CountEateries.java`

The code you download includes a class `CountEateries` that reads a file of data, e.g., `data/foodlarge.txt` and determines how many `Person201` objects like each of the 33 different Ninth Street eateries. When run, this count is printed as zero/0 for each eatery until you modify/add to the code in method `countEateries` which returns zero for every value of parameter `eatery`. You'll need to write code to count how many `Person201` objects, say named `p`, in the array parameter `people` have `p.eatery().equals(eatery)`. Write code by looping over the array and checking every object's `.eatery()` value for equality with parameter `eatery`. Copy/paste the output you get into your **analysis questions** document.

The last several lines of eatery data should be:
```
3:	The Loop
2:	The Tavern
6:	Vin Rouge
4:	Zenfish Poke Bar
--------
total = 97
```

## Checklist

Before you submit to Gradescope, check that you've done each of the following:

- Modify `Person201.java` by changing code in two places.
- Verify that running `Person201Demo.java` matches the expected output after modifying `Person201.java`
- Add a new `Person201` object in the `Person201Demo.java` program and verify that running `Person201Demo.java` matches the expected output.
- Run `Person201Nearby.java` , find threshold values as indicated, and verify that reading a file and the corresponding URL produce the same results.
- Create a new class `Person201Farthest` (in a new file named accordingly) with a `main` method to find the two distinct (i.e., inequal) people furthest apart from each other.
- Modify method `countEateries` in class `CountEateries` so it finds data appropriately.

## Submission

You'll submit by pushing your code to Git and using Gradescope. Details can be found in [the details/FAQ](docs/details.md).

## Analysis

Answer all the questions here. As outlined in [this document](docs/details.md) you'll submit a PDF with your answers to Gradescope as a separate assignment.

### Question 1 (1 point)
- How many instance variables are there in the class `Person201`?
- How many constructors are there in `Person201` after it has been modified?

### Question 2 (1 point)
- Does the main method of your `Person201Farthest.java` create any objects of type `Person201Utilities`? Why or why not?

### Question 3 (2 points)

What is the smallest value of variable `threshold` in `Person201Nearby` that yields exactly three people near to Ricardo. Write a few sentences about how you found the value, essentially providing an algorithm for anyone to replicate your work so that with a different/new data file they could find the smallest such value **efficiently**.


### Question 4 (2 points)
The online data for this project read via URL is **not encrypted**. In a few sentences, why would it be reasonable to have the online data encrypted?

### Question 5 (1 point)
According to the `.equals` method of the `Person201` class, when are two `Person201` objects considered to be equal? Is it case sensitive for their names or for their phrases? (Case sensitive means different answers are returned depending on capitalization).

### Question 6 (1 point)
As stated at the start of this document and in the course policies, you should record via Zoom the first 20 minutes of you working at the beginning of this project and submit a link to that recording using [the link https://duke.is/zoom-p0-fall24](https://duke.is/zoom-p0-fall24). In your analysis document, include as an answer to this last question an affirmation "Yes, I submitted the URL for a Zoom recording." -- if, in fact, you did. Otherwise indicate you forgot to/refused to.
